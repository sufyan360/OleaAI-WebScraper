It is very important that once this programme is in place, we can vaccinate children. There are ways to do that even with the MVA-BN vaccine. But that is being discussed with the regulators, SAGE. The Strategic Advisory Group on Immunisation has made recommendations for off-label use of this vaccine, subject to certain conditions being met.  So everyone is working hard to ensure that children are vaccinated in the context of this outbreak, but we also have to pay due attention to the regulatory process, safety, efficacy, and ensure that if these opportunities are taken up, we collect the necessary safety and efficacy data and that the health and well-being of the population is always at the forefront of our minds...\""

We see it through the care of caregivers, mothers to children, for example. There are quite a few infants that have been infected. Could happen through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is very important for mothers and their babies. So there's a lot of different ways that it's being transmitted. And what we're trying to do in the field with partners is to better distinguish the different ways in which this virus is transmitting among children, among adults to children, children to adults also in the context of sex workers, so that the messaging that we put out there to prevent the spread can be much more targeted.\""
